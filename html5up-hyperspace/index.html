									<h2>Get to know me!</h2>
									<p>Hello! My name is Ramsha and I am a recent graduate of Boston University with a Bachelors degree in Computer Science! I am currently actively looking for Product-facing roles and am an aspiring Product Manager. I’ve had previous Product Management work experiences in the past that have really solidified my passion for this space and I think being in such a dynamic role, where I got to interact with so many different people from different backgrounds is what really made me want to gravitate towards a Product focused role, rather than taking the conventional software engineering route that most CS majors take. I believe some of my strong suits include having an innate desire to better myself and further develop both my soft skills as well as my technical skills. I am also passionate about finding solutions to real-world issues from a technology-driven lens, as well as enocouraging and empowering more women to join STEM-related fields!</p>

									<h2>Proud to be BU!</h2>
									<p>I attended Boston University from 2016 - 2020 where I received a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. My time at BU was truly a once in a lifetime experience and there is no other university I would've chosen to spend the most formative four years of my life. I met some of my best friends here and became apart of communities that helped empower individuals through their missions. I also had the opportunity to work alongside very talented professors when conducting research projects.</p>

									<h2>My personal passions!</h2>
									<p>On a more personal note, I enjoy spending my free-time by listening to music, watching movies, hanging out with family/friends, listening to podcasts, finding cool vintage stores, and traveling   (pre-covid)! I definitely believe in maintaining a strong work-life balance as it increases overall productivity and helps you remain grounded in both the professional and personal aspects of your life.</p>
